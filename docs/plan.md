# Plan

Here are some development plans.

- Optimize Chinese documents and show more examples.
- ~~Optimize the syntax expression of broadcast-service~~
- Provide more test cases
- Privide the ability to subscribe the topic and callback once `(developing)`
- Support for fuzzy subscriptions

`(developing)` means I am going to do. As for other plans,if you want to contribute to this project, you can submit pr or issue and tells me which one you want to do. I am glad to see more people involved and optimize it.
