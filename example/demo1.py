    This demo aim to show how to use broadcast-service.
    Scene:
        One day, leader Tom arrive the company but find not one staff in company
        because all staff are playing outside. Therefor, Tom send a message
        everyone must must return to company now. Jack, Jasmine, Jane go back
        now when they receive the message. Actually, they need different time to go back
        in different places and they need to declare that they are back when they back.
    Attention:
        broadcast-service is asynchronous by defalut. If you want to close the async
        state. You can use:
            broadcast_service.enable_async = False
        to close the async statement.
